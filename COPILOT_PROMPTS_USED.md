# COPILOT PROMPTS USED

This document contains a chronological record of all prompts sent to GitHub Copilot during the development of the portfolio website project. Each entry includes the prompt number, timestamp, and the full text of the prompt.

# EXACT PROMPT TO USE FOR CREATING SIMILAR DOCUMENTS

```
Create a markdown file named CONVERSATION_HISTORY.md that documents all prompts in our conversation. Format each entry with:
1. Sequential numbered headings (## Prompt 1, ## Prompt 2, etc.)
2. Timestamp in italics directly under each heading (*YYYY-MM-DD, HH:MM*)
3. Full prompt text on a new line after the timestamp
4. Add a brief introduction explaining that this document tracks all AI interactions chronologically

Begin the file with a descriptive title and save it to the root directory of my project.
```

Can you create a markdown listing all the prompts you have received and you have access to in this project, today. Call it COPILOT_PROMPTS_USED.md. Make each prompt a heading and put a timestamp date, hour, minute.

## Prompt 4
*2025-04-19, 19:53*

Can you update the? Prompts. Add is description about what this document is. And also. The heading has to just say prompt and a number. That's all. And the date stamp, the actual content has to be underneath it, so can you just do that now?
